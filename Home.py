    NEAR Protocol is a decentralized application (dApp) platform and Ethereum competitor 
    that focuses on developer and user-friendliness. Its native NEAR tokens are used to pay 
    for transaction fees and storage on the Near crypto platform. NEAR is a Proof-of-Stake 
    blockchain that uses sharding technology to achieve scalability.
    \n 
    NEARâ€™s native token is also called NEAR, and is used to pay for transaction fees and storage. 
    NEAR tokens can also be staked by token holders who participate in achieving network consensus 
    as transaction validators.
    Projects building on NEAR include Mintbase, a non-fungible token (NFT) minting platform, 
    and Flux, a protocol that allows developers to create markets based on assets, commodities, 
    real-world events, and more.
